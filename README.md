- I am planning to build a website which includes all the information during the natural disaster dos and don'ts. This website will provide the user with all the steps to stay safe during a particular natural disaster. I am also planning to include a chatbot which will help the user to stay calm during the crisis. This chatbot will help him with contact details of local and national authoirity.

- The basic website layout will be user friendly so that user can navigate to necessary information. To use the chatbot simply start talking to the bot and it will try to help the user accordingly.

- Users can simply browse the website for dos and don'ts during a particular natural disaster. Additionally they can chat with the chatbot to get information more quickly and get what they require.

- For the data on website I will be using wikipedia and other online data about natural disaster. Additionally I will be using data about the contact details of authoirties that can help the user in the crisis of natural disaster. 

-Technologies I might use:
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Natural Langugae Processing (NLP)
ChatBot
github
Python
